###Fix sloppy coding through negative reinforcement!

Ever mistype `git push`? Want to fix that? git-psuh has your back!

*Every time* you mistype `git push`, this command will force-push an totally empty branch instead of your current branch. Not only that, but it also force pushes `master`!

## Installation

## Usage
